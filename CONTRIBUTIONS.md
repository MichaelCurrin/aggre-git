# How to contribute to Aggre-Git


`master` and `develop` are protected-branches and require approved Pull Requests to add changes.

To submit changes, create a feature branch and create a PR to merge into `develop`. If not a collaborator, you will have to fork the repo first and submit a PR from fork's feature branch into the original's `develop` branch.
