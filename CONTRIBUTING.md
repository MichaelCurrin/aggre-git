# How to contribute to Aggre-Git


`develop` is a protected-branch and requires approved Pull Requests to add changes.

To submit changes, create a feature branch and create a PR to merge into `develop`. If not a collaborator, you will have to fork the repo first and submit a PR from fork's feature branch into the original's `develop` branch.

There was previously a `master` branch which is no longer required.
